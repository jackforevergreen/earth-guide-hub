# Firebase Integration Complete

## Summary
Successfully integrated Firebase authentication and Firestore database for cross-platform carbon calculator data tracking between the website and mobile app.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Authentication System
- **Email/Password**: Users can sign up and log in with email
- **Google Sign-In**: One-click authentication with Google
- **Apple Sign-In**: One-click authentication with Apple (web compatible)
- **LoginModal Component**: Beautiful modal with all three auth methods
- **Navigation Integration**: "Get Started" button replaced with dynamic "Log In" or "Profile" button

### 2. Profile Page (`/profile`)
- Displays user account information (email, name, account creation date)
- Shows current month's carbon footprint data
- Breakdown of emissions by category (Transportation, Diet, Energy)
- Sign out functionality
- Link to retake calculator

### 3. Data Persistence
- **Auto-save**: When logged-in users complete the calculator, data is automatically saved to Firestore
- **Auto-load**: When logged-in users visit the calculator, their existing data is loaded
- **Community Stats**: Total community emissions are updated with each calculation
- **Monthly Tracking**: Data is stored by month (YYYY-MM format) for historical tracking

### 4. User Flow
1. **New User (Not Logged In)**:
   - Completes carbon calculator
   - Sees results on Breakdown page
   - Prompted with banner: "Save Your Progress!"
   - Can sign up to save data

2. **Returning User (Logged In)**:
   - Logs in via Navigation
   - Goes to Profile to see current month's data
   - Can retake calculator (data will be loaded)
   - Data auto-saves when completing calculator

### 5. Files Created
```

├── lib/
│   └── firebase.ts                    # Firebase initialization & config
├── api/
│   └── emissions.ts                   # Firestore data operations

└── pages/
    └── Profile.tsx                   # User profile page
```

### 6. Files Modified
- `src/components/Navigation.tsx` - Added login/profile button with auth state
- `src/pages/CarbonCalculator.tsx` - Added data loading on mount
- `src/components/carbon-calculator/Breakdown.tsx` - Added data saving + login prompt
- `src/App.tsx` - Added `/profile` route

### 7. Environment Variables
Created `.env.local` with Firebase credentials from mobile app's project:
- Same Firebase project used across web and mobile
- Enables cross-platform data synchronization

## Firebase Data Structure

### User Emissions Data
```
users/{userId}/emissions/{YYYY-MM}
  - surveyData: Object (all survey responses)
  - surveyEmissions: Object (calculated emissions)
  - totalEmissions: number
  - monthlyEmissions: number
  - lastUpdated: Timestamp
```

### Community Stats
```
community/emissions_stats
  - emissions_calculated: number
  - emissions_offset: number
  - last_updated: Timestamp
```

## Features
✅ Email/Password authentication
✅ Google OAuth
✅ Apple OAuth
✅ User profile page
✅ Auto-save emissions data
✅ Auto-load existing data
✅ Cross-platform data sync (web ↔ mobile)
✅ Login prompt for anonymous users
✅ Community emissions tracking
✅ Monthly historical data

## Usage

### Starting Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Testing Authentication
1. Visit `http://localhost:8080`
2. Click "Log In" in navigation
3. Create account or sign in
4. Complete carbon calculator
5. Data will be saved automatically
6. Visit `/profile` to see your data

## Firebase Console
- Project ID: `fg-react-app`
- Console: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/fg-react-app

## Security
- Firestore security rules should be configured to:
  - Allow users to only read/write their own emissions data
  - Allow all authenticated users to read community stats
  - Only allow authenticated users to update community stats

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)
- [ ] View historical data (past months)
- [ ] Data visualization charts
- [ ] Month-over-month comparison
- [ ] Export data functionality
- [ ] Password reset functionality
- [ ] Email verification
- [ ] User settings page
