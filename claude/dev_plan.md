## Reusability Assessment: React Native ‚Üí Web

### **Highly Reusable Components**
1. **Payment Logic** - Stripe integration patterns
2. **Product Display** - Carbon credit showcase components
3. **Cart Management** - Shopping cart state logic
4. **Authentication Flows** - Firebase auth patterns
5. **Data Structures** - TypeScript interfaces and types

### **Components Requiring Adaptation**
1. **UI Components** - Convert React Native Paper ‚Üí shadcn/ui
2. **Navigation** - Expo Router ‚Üí React Router DOM
3. **Storage** - AsyncStorage ‚Üí localStorage/sessionStorage
4. **Image Handling** - expo-image ‚Üí regular img/next/Image
5. **Platform-specific Payment** - Apple/Google Pay ‚Üí Web payments

### **Recommended Approach**
1. **Extract business logic** from React Native components
2. **Create web-specific UI** using existing shadcn/ui components
3. **Maintain data structures** and API calls
4. **Share TypeScript types** between projects
